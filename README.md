# LocateMate

LocateMate is a social media application centered around a location-based guessing game, enabling users to share adventures through photo uploads and location guessing. 

## Description

When creating a post, the user is able to take a photo, get their location pinned, and add a song choice. Once posted, friends are free to comment and guess on their post. Friends' guesses on each others posts are displayed in a Post Leaderboard, where the closest guess is ranked number 1. Once a user guesses on any post, their average guess is calculated and displayed in a Friend Leaderboard, where all of a user's friends (including them) are ranked by the average of every guess they have made. This adds a game-like effect to the application.
